# FordGo Bike Trip Data Exploration
## by Bello Victor


## Dataset

> The data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. It has 183412 rows and 16 columns. Among the variables recorded are: start time, end time, station name, station latitude and longitude. Transformation of the date and year columns were made from object and float to datetime and integer respectively. The transformations were necessary to plot the data accurately. 


## Summary of Findings

### Exploratory Analysis
> The frequency of different user_types was plotted. There are two user types which are: customer and subscriber.  It was observed that of the two types the predominant one is the subscriber.

> The count of birth years was plotted from the dataset and it was uncovered that the year 1988 had the most riders birth, closely followed by the year 1993. So evidently older people rode more.

> The frequency of gender was plotted from the dataset and the predominant gender was the male gender. So more males ride the bikes.

> It was found out that most of the rides taken have a duration within an hour. There were very little outliers recorded in this plot.

> Plotting the count of riders that share bikes or not, it was deduced that more riders do not share bikes than the opposite occurence.


> For the plot of user_type and gender, it was discovered that for both customers and subscribers there more males than females. Although more variation was found in the subscribers category.

> The gender type and ride duration was analysed and it was found out that there was negligible variation between genders regarding time of travel.

> From the plot of duration against bike share it was concluded that there was no variation in time whether there was a bike share or not.

> More males who are subcribers took more rides.

## Key Insights for Presentation

> The birth years with the most riders gives an insight into the distribution of people that take these rides.

> The proportion of riders that share bikes.

> Its also important to note that when it comes to duration of bike ride regarding gender type, there is no apparent variation between genders.
